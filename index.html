    <h1>CLOUD COMPUTING</h1>

    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. It includes data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. Cloud storage has grown increasingly popular among individuals who need larger storage space and for businesses seeking an efficient off-site data back-up solution.</p>

    <h2>BENEFITS</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing has been around for approximately two decades and despite the data pointing to the business efficiencies, cost-benefits, and competitive advantages it holds, a large portion of the business community continues to operate without it. According to a study by the International Data Group, 69% of businesses are already using cloud technology in one capacity or another, and 18% say they plan to implement cloud-computing solutions at some point.</p>

    <h2>USED FOR</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing is used for a wide range of applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
